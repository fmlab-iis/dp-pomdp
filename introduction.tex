% importance of privacy and its formal analysis

Privacy has been a hotly debated issue since late nineteenth
century~\cite{WB:90:RP}. With the advent of social media, privacy is
perhaps one of the most relevant topics in the digital age as
well. Indeed, numerous privacy measures for publishing data 
have been proposed~\cite{S:2002:KAMPP,FWC:10:PPDP}. Whether these
measures are taken properly and effectively concerns every
individuals. The importance of privacy research is thus noted by the
formal method community as well~\cite{TW:09:FMP}.

% differential privacy

Differential privacy is a framework for the design of privacy
measures~\cite{D:06:DP,DR:14:AFDP}. In the framework, data publishing
mechanisms are formalized as randomized algorithms. On any input data
set, such mechanisms return randomized answers to data users' queries. 
Output distributions naturally correspond to information released by
data publishing mechanisms. In order to preserve privacy, data
curators suffice to ensure that similar output distributions are
yielded by mechanisms on similar input data sets. Thanks to its simple
formalization, differential privacy moreover allows data curators 
to evaluate privacy and utility quantitatively. The framework
subsequently attracts lots of attentions from academia and industry.
