% importance of privacy and its formal analysis

Privacy has been a hotly debated issue since late nineteenth
century~\cite{WB:90:RP}. Lots of discussions can be found in
philosophy and jurisprudence over the years. With the advent of social
media, privacy is perhaps one of the most relevant topics in the
digital age. Indeed, numerous privacy measures for publishing data
have been proposed~\cite{S:2002:KAMPP,FWC:10:PPDP}.
